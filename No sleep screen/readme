# Auto Clicker using PyAutoGUI
This is a Python script for an auto-clicker using the PyAutoGUI library. It simulates mouse clicks after a certain time interval.

## Installation
First, make sure you have PyAutoGUI installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:


pip install pyautogui

## Usage
Import PyAutoGUI library:

import pyautogui
In an infinite loop, use pyautogui.sleep() function to pause the execution for a specified time interval. In the below code, the script sleeps for 40 seconds:

while True:
    pyautogui.sleep(40)
Use pyautogui.click(x, y) function to simulate the mouse click at the specified (x, y) co-ordinates. In the below code, the script clicks on the co-ordinates (50, 400) after every 40 seconds:


while True:
    pyautogui.sleep(40)
    pyautogui.click(50, 400)
Note: Be careful when running this script, as it may accidentally click on unwanted areas of your screen.

## Conclusion
This is a simple implementation of an auto-clicker using the PyAutoGUI library. It can be further modified to suit specific use cases.
