# Speed Test
This program measures the internet speed of your connection using Python. It uses two different libraries to perform the test. The first library used is speedtest. 
The commented part uses pyspeedtest library. Both works fine.

## Installation
You can install the speedtest library using pip:


pip install speedtest-cli

Both libraries provide similar functionality, so you can choose whichever one you prefer.
