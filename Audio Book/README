# Text-to-Speech with Pyttsx3
This code demonstrates how to use the pyttsx3 library to convert text into speech.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this code, you will need to install the pyttsx3 library. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pyttsx3
## Usage
Save the text you want to convert to speech as a text file (e.g., book.txt).
Update the code to specify the correct path to the text file (e.g., book = open(r"book.txt")).
## Run the code.
The text will be read aloud using the default system voice. You can modify the voice used and other parameters by changing the arguments passed to pyttsx3.init().
