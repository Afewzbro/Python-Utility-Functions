This is a simple alarm clock program that allows you to set a time and date for an alarm. You can choose to have the alarm play a music file or sound a beep.

## Getting Started

Python 3.x

winsound library (only available on Windows machines)
### Installing
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install playsound

(Note: winsound is only available on Windows machines and is already included in Python's standard library)
## Usage
Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
Copy code
python alarm.py
Input the date and time you want the alarm to go off.
Choose between a music file or a beep sound.
If you chose a beep sound, enter the duration in seconds and frequency of the noise.
The program will display a message "setting alarm..." to let you know that the alarm has been set.
When the alarm goes off, the program will play the chosen sound and display a message "Time's up!"
